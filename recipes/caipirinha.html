                <h3>A refreshing Brazilian cocktail</h3>
                    <p>
                        The word <strong>caipirinha</strong> is the diminutive of the word <em>caipira</em>, which in Brazilian Portuguese refers to someone from the countryside (specifically, someone from the rural parts of south-central Brazil), similar to US English <em>hillbilly</em> or the Lowland Scots <em>teuchter</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>caipirinha</strong> is the strongest national cocktail of Brazil, and is imbibed in restaurants, bars, and many households throughout the country. 
                        Once almost unknown outside Brazil, the drink became more popular and more widely available in recent years, in large part due to the rising availability of first-rate brands of <strong>cachaça</strong> outside Brazil. 
                        <em>The International Bartenders Association</em> designated it as one of its Official Cocktails, as a <strong>Contemporary Classic</strong>.
