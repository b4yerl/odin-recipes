                <h3>The Brazilian national dish</h3>
                <p> 
                    Imagine it's Sunday, the sun is high and you're going back home for <em>lunch</em>. 
                    You're definitely hungry, you've just spent all morning at the <em>beach</em> and guess what will probably be your meal? That's right, <strong>a salty and delicious black bean stew</strong>, followed by a <em>football</em> match on TV or some Samba music, 'cause why not?
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a celebratory dish, <strong>feijoada</strong> is traditionally served on <strong>Saturday afternoons or Sunday lunch</strong> and intended to be a leisurely midday meal. 
                    It is meant to be enjoyed throughout the day and not eaten under rushed circumstances. 
                    The meal is usually eaten among extended family and paired with an event like watching a football match or other social event. Because of the dish's heavy ingredients and rich flavors, feijoada is viewed as <em>Brazilian soul food</em>. In the city of São Paulo, feijoada is a typical dish in working-class restaurants on Wednesdays and Saturdays, mainly in the commercial area. In Rio de Janeiro, restaurants traditionally serve it on Fridays. The dish is normally served with a choice among a selection of meats, e.g. pork, bacon, pig ears, pig feet, to fulfill the customer's needs.
