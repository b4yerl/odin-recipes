                <h3>The Northeastern sea flavor</h3>
                <p>
                    This fish stew, called moqueca, is a very typical, traditional Brazilian dish that originated in the Northeast.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moqueca is typically made with shrimp or fish as a base with tomatoes, onions, garlic, lime and coriander. The name moqueca comes from the term <em>mu'keka</em> in Kimbundu language (Angola dialect), traditional plate (pirão). 
                    The full meal set is the fish stew, stew of banana da terra (plantains stewed in the same manner as the fish), pirão (porridge made from cassava flour), and white rice, each one in its own clay pan. 
                    Moqueca was featured on the <strong>Netflix</strong>> TV series, <em>Street Food volume 2</em>, which focused on Latin American Street Foods.
